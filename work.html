<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<div class="work">
<p>
	I am currently a research assistant at <a href = "https://lettersmith.ai.umich.edu/">Lettersmith AI</a> at the University of Michigan School of Information.
	I collaborate with a team of researchers to prepare a website that helps students draft professional emails and analyze data through Excel by categorizing inputs into the different aspects needed in an email to then use Machine Learning to ultimately teach the technology to automatically make these classifications.

<p>
	This past summer I worked as a Data Science Intern at <a href = "https://arena.africa/">Arena Holdings,</a> an international media company based in South Africa. I worked remotely to assist them to remain competitive in their industry
	 and remain one of Africaâ€™s largest news publishers. Specifically, I joined client information from multiple data tables from Excel and Google Analytics using SQL, segmented and visualized data using Clustering Analysis
	  to make predictions on customer retention, and formatted and presented my deliverables to the company for them to utilize in reevaluating their services.
