	I am a Peer Educator at <a href = "https://caps.umich.edu/">The University of Michigan's Counseling and Psychological Services.</a> as
	part of their Body Project program where I lead discussions, provide mentoring, and develop resources to combat poor body image in a program designed to promote health and wellness for undergraduate women. 
	I have been part of this program since its origin on this campus and helped initiate it.

	Between high school and college, I took a gap year where I lived in Israel in a foster home, as a foster home assistant.
	I worked in congruence with foster parents, therapists and foster children to aid the relationships and communication between parties, bridged the language barrier while living in a home where Hebrew was the primary language spoken, and 
	instilled trust of the foster care system in the foster care children.
