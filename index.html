<h2>About</h2>
<div class="about">
<p>
	On this site I am going to tell you a little bit about myself.
</p>
<p>
	I am a Junior at the Unversity of Michigan in the School of Information. This program intrigued me because it is the 
	intersection of people, information and technology. When I first came to school here I was thinking about majoring in either 
	Psychology or Computer Science, therefore the School of Information was perfect for me because it allowed me to combine my interests. 
	I get to use my coding background to work with people and help them with whatever is asked of me.
</p>
<p>
	I am majoring in Data Analytics. This allows me to formulate questions that are important to stakeholders and develop solutions in data.
	I enjoy being able to look at a messy dataset and be able to work on it and create visualizations that will clearly provide answers to the 
	problems I am trying to solve. 
</p>
<p>
	I am also minoring in Entrepreneurship and learning business basics to be able to foster my creativity and learn how to make my ideas successful.
